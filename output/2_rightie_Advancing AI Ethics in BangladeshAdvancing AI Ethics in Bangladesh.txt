The article on advancing AI ethics in Bangladesh presents a rather utopian view of how technology, particularly AI, can benefit society when developed and deployed ethically. However, it misses a crucial point: the inherent tendency of such initiatives to prioritize control and bureaucratic regulation, potentially stifling innovation and disenfranchising those who stand to gain the most—namely, the private sector and, in many cases, the wealthier classes.

**Notes to Self:** Remind myself that while ethics in AI is a popular topic among certain circles, the real-world implementation often becomes a smokescreen for more government intervention and control—something that should be resisted.

The commendable efforts of UNESCO and its proposed Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) may come with good intentions, but it's vital to scrutinize who truly benefits from this approach. Emphasis on 'ethical' AI often serves to reinforce existing power structures rather than dismantle them. For instance, who decides what constitutes ethical use? It is the elites, the globalists, who often dictate these terms, ensuring that their interests are safeguarded while simultaneously curtailing competition from up-and-coming innovators.

**Notes to Self:** Note how the rhetoric of “ethical frameworks” often translates into compliance with regulatory standards that heavyweights can navigate with ease, while smaller players are left to flounder under bureaucratic weight.

The fact that this initiative is framed with the idea of readiness and governance suggests a worrying trend toward centralizing control over technology, rather than promoting a diverse market environment where innovation thrives. Sure, the goal seems noble—creating an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with global standards—and yet, these "global standards" are often imposed by international organizations that typically do not have the interests of individual nations at heart.

**Notes to Self:** Keep an eye on the implications of global standards—they often cater to the pillars of power, undermining local contexts and opportunities for economic empowerment.

Furthermore, while the intention behind assessing a country's technological infrastructure, legislation, and economy is notable, such assessments can lead to a sense of dependency on foreign entities like UNESCO. This could ultimately diminish national sovereignty and local initiative in technological advancement.

**Notes to Self:** Emphasize the importance of national sovereignty and self-reliance in tech development—it's not just about ethics; it's about who controls the narrative and the resources.

AI ethics should not be a justification for establishing bureaucracies that could constrict the very innovation they seek to promote. It would be more beneficial to encourage a free market approach where businesses can self-regulate and create technologies that cater to the needs and desires of the populous without being bogged down by onerous regulations.

In conclusion, while there is merit to considering the ethical implications of AI, we must tread carefully. History has shown us that such initiatives often come at the cost of freedom and market dynamism. The true call to action should be for a robust laissez-faire approach to AI development, allowing for innovation and wealth creation to flourish, rather than adopting a framework that likely serves to entrench inequities in the economic landscape.

**Notes to Self:** Advocate for freedom over regulation—remind readers that true ‘ethical AI’ aligns with free-market principles, empowering individuals rather than constraining them.
