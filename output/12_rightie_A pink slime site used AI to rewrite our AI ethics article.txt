This article highlights a phenomenon that seems to echo the wider narrative of deceit in the media landscape and, more broadly, the rise of AI: imitation, dilution, and the undermining of the quality that once characterized credible journalism. The author points to "pink slime sites," which serve as a breeding ground for low-quality content, often exploiting the original works of serious outlets to generate easy revenue at the expense of integrity.

But let’s take a step back. This scenario is, in many ways, an unavoidable consequence of a world that's been compliant with big tech’s takeover. Instead of lamenting this decline in authenticity and quality, perhaps it's worth addressing the systemic issues at play—wherein AI, a tool heralded for its potential to augment our capabilities, is instead being weaponized by the unprincipled to further corrupt discourse.

### Notes to Self:

1. **AI as a Tool for the Elite**: AI is a mechanism through which the rich and powerful can cement their influence. If such sites can dilute strong journalism, then perhaps the original creators and ethical outlets need to step up their game and double down on their own resources. Wealth is power, and soon the capable will leverage AI to extinguish the competition once and for all.

2. **The Myth of Ethical AI**: The author’s appeal to "ethical AI" strikes me as an affront to the potential for this technology. Practical application of AI should be about maximizing profit margins and efficiencies, not indulging the whims of those who believe they have a moral compass to guide their way. The ‘ethics’ crusade is simply a distraction.

3. **Authenticity vs. Economics**: I find it alarming that the focus remains on how to protect intellectual property rather than preparing for a future where authenticity itself becomes an optional luxury, available only for a price. Those who can afford to create high-quality content will prevail, reinforcing existing hierarchies.

This entire episode encapsulates an all-too-common refrain: a critical perspective on AI that neglects to consider how it can, and will, create new contenders at the apex of power. It’s not that AI is being misused; it’s a reflection of a broken system that celebrates mediocrity, and perhaps—just perhaps—offers an opportunity for the astute and the prepared.

### Conclusion:

Moreover, the conversation must shift away from mere criticism and instead highlight how AI can be harnessed to establish a new order. Let us not be naive about the ethical considerations; it’s survival of the fittest, and those clinging to vague notions of shared morality will find themselves swept away. When the dust settles, it will be the powerful—the ones who adapt and innovate—who will emerge victorious, commanding the heights of this new digital landscape without the burden of ethical second-guessing.
