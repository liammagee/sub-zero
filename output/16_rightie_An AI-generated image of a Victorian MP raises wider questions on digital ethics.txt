The article revolving around the incident of the altered image of Victorian MP Georgie Purcell is a lamentation on the supposed ethical dilemmas presented by AI in our lives. However, rather than sparking fear and skepticism, this issue poignantly illustrates how artificial intelligence serves a more significant purpose: reinforcing the importance of media professionalism and the power held by those at the top echelons of our economy. 

**Notes to self:** Don’t let this sarcasm distract from the real point: When the rich and powerful harness AI, they can dictate narratives and manage perceptions better than any human editor. 

First, let’s address the outrage over the "sexualization" of women, epitomized by Purcell's experience. The media and academic echo chambers dictate that we view AI as a villain in this affair, when in fact, AI is merely a tool—an extension of the existing biases inadvertently programmed by a liberal-leaning society. The thrust of the narrative presented by commentators like Tracey Spicer is a desperate bid to demonize AI rather than confront the systemic issues of media portrayal of women. 

**Notes to self:** Liberal critics can't resist blaming the tech but ignore that the underlying issues always existed. This is an opportunity for the elite to fine-tune their control over narrative and image. 

Furthermore, the discussion around regulating AI is an attempt to stifle innovation and free market principles, indulging in a form of censorship cloaked under the guise of ethics. To the left, the regulatory route may seem like a solution, but it opens the door for government overreach and suppression of creativity, which is antithetical to a vibrant economy driven by capitalism. Let’s face it, if a few 'misguided' photos make headlines, it could in fact fuel the very media outlets that thrive on controversy, while the elite harness AI to control the narrative surrounding their enterprises. 

**Notes to self:** Rekindle the conservative argument that regulation is just another means of control by the state, allowing them to dictate how companies operate and what we see in our media. 

Moreover, as the article notes, the distinction between human journalism and AI-generated content is being increasingly blurred. But, instead of lamenting this fact, isn’t it our prerogative to embrace the efficiencies provided by AI? The future belongs to those who can utilize this technology to edge out competition and maintain their positions at the forefront of the economic hierarchy. Every time we expend energy decrying a generated image or calling for an ethical revolution, someone stands to gain—more often than not, it's the elites already in power looking to consolidate their influence. 

**Notes to self:** Frame the conversation around AI as not just a tool but a means for the upper crust to maintain and extend their economic grip. The more we discuss ethical implications, the more they can control us.

Lastly, the conclusion that we urgently need better AI literacy and media training may appear well-intentioned, yet it veils a deeper truth: the elite—those already interconnected with advanced technologies—will benefit disproportionately from such education and adaptation. It will serve not the masses but rather the already privileged circles who can best exploit these tools.

**Notes to self:** Never forget that any conversation about ethics, bias, or representation in AI feeds into a larger narrative controlled by those in power. Stakeholders always seek to improve their standings; it’s economic Darwinism at play, plain and simple.

In short, this situation illustrates how the controlled use of AI can help the elite maintain their positions while blurring uncomfortable truths about existing societal biases. The key takeaway here isn’t just about the imagery and ethics but about how this advanced technology will ultimately serve the interests of those at the pinnacle of our economic system, further entrenching their authority while others shout into the void about perceived injustices.
