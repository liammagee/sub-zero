misreporting my income while on Newstart during the 2014/15 financial
year. I disputed the debt but lost so had to repay the full amount.
Centrelink has sent me a letter today stating that: “We are refunding
money to people who made repayments to eligible income compliance debts.
Our records indicate that you previously had debt/s raised using
averaging of ATO information. We no longer do this and will refund the
repayments you made to your nominated bank account.” Hell yes!</td>

their best, in sometimes very difficult circumstances, to deal with the

<p>Changes made:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was more critical in applying scores, only applying them to what I
thought were the most relevant themes.</li>
<li>I was more parsimonious with scores, avoiding over-scoring.</li>
<li>I was more critical of statements that appeared to be couched in
rhetoric of excuse-making, and did not apply scores to themes like
‘Denial of Personal Responsibility’ unless it was explicitly
stated.</li>
<li>I revised scores based on a more nuanced understanding of the themes
and their relevance to each statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this revised table provides a more accurate and nuanced
representation of the themes present in each statement.</p>
